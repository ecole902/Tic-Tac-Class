# Tic-Tac-Class
This is brute-forced game of Tic Tac Toe using Java's Drawing Panel. 

It was based off an assignment made by Professor Andrew Amorelli at University of Southern Maine, which was also based off of an assignment by Professor David Briggs. 

The primary point of this assignment was to create two methods, takeTurn and checkWin. 

The fun part about takeTurn was 1) deciding how to switch off players, 2) reading user input 3) compensating for incorrect/invalid input, such as when a player tries to play in an already occupied slot. 

I researched different methods for checkWin halfway through the project. Initially I had planned to bruteforce the method, and I want to redo this soon to take into account the current player's position and checkWin based on that instead of checking every single row, column, diagonal and anti-diagonal every single time.
